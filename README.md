# ASP.NET vNext Docker Image

This Docker image contains a ready-to-go environment to run [ASP.NET vNext][vnext] applications in Linux using [Mono][mono].

See the `Dockerfile` for more details about how the image is built. The image is officially built on [Docker Hub][hub-link].

### Image build outline

* Base image is `debian:latest`
* Installs latest stable Mono version (as of writing Mono 3.8.0)
* Updates the certificate store, installs NuGet/MyGet SSL certificates.
* Installs the latest ASP.NET vNext (from its `dev` feed).

This should get you a working image with latest official Mono/ASP.NET vNext bits. 

### Build upon this image

If you are writing a Dockerfile, begin with:

    FROM ahmetalpbalkan/aspnet-vnext

Or pull this image using the `docker` command:

    $ docker pull ahmetalpbalkan/aspnet-vnext

and play with the image you downloaded.

If you're planning to make a command like `k web` your ENTRYPOINT in your Dockerfile it should look
like this:

    ENTRYPOINT k web

While starting your container, please run it with `docker run -t -d` switches since `k` command requires
TTY to stay alive and `-t` will attach a pseudo-TTY to the process.

### Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with Microsoft or ASP.NET. It is independently maintained and the purpose
is to have a base Docker image where binaries are coming from official Mono & ASP.NET GitHub repositories
and versions are picked as stable ones working reliably.

### Known issues

* (low-pri) `k` command terminates just after starting while in the container because it expects some input
from STDIN. You should use `docker run -i` to keep the process alive. ([See issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting/issues/59))

### TODO

- [x] Wait for Mono to release a â‰¥3.6 tag and fix the Mono build number to a stable.
- [ ] Find a way to fix kvm installation (kvminstall.sh) to a stable build.
- [ ] Add link to example Dockerfile built upon this image.
- [ ] Write a blog post about this.
- [ ] Talk about this in a meetup.
